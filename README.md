# Redwood Chat Server

Redwood is the name of a new fledgling chat application, built with
end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on the [Messaging Layer Security (MLS)][mls]
protocol with identity rooted in [ATProto][atproto] (the protocol that
underlies the [Bluesky][bsky] social network).

This repository is for the _server_ application for Redwood, which
hosts individual communities and their channels.

## Warning

This server application is still in its very early days. Do not use
it. That said, contributions are welcome!
